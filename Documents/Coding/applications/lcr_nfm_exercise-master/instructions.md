# Nonfat Media Front End Engineer Code Exercise
Thanks for applying to join the Nonfat Media team as a Front End Engineer! We're excited to see how you approach this exercise.

**Instructions**
You will be building a small web app that displays a list of projects (often referred to as "breakdowns") and allows the user to mark whether they're interested in each project.

Your app should have the following functionality:

1. Retrieve the list of breakdowns from the provided file `projects.json`
2. Display the list in reverse chronological order by the "added" timestamp. Please display all key-value pairs provided for each breakdown. **Bonus points if the UI is fully responsive and looks good on all screen sizes.**
3. Display an "I'm Interested" checkbox for each breakdown and allow the user to toggle the checkbox between interested/not interested. **Bonus points if checkbox state persists on refresh.**

You may use any combination of front-end libraries and frameworks. We'd like to see you implement the exercise using the technologies you're most comfortable with, but keep in mind we'll be reviewing your code for simplicity, readability, and reusability.

Once you're done with the exercise, please package the project in a .zip file and email it to joe@nonfatmedia.com. If your implementation requires any specific build or deploy steps to get the app up and running, please include instructions with your deliverable. Please let us know if you have any questions while you're working on the exercise. Thank you!
